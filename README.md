##  What is Weather Forecasting?

**Weather forecasting** is the process of predicting the atmospheric conditions of a specific place for a certain period—like temperature, rain, wind, or clouds. It helps people prepare for upcoming weather events.

###  Why is it important?

-  Helps people plan their daily activities
-  Assists farmers in crop planning
-  Aids flight scheduling and safety
-  Warns communities about dangerous weather like storms or floods

###  How does it work?

Weather forecasting uses:
- **Data** from satellites, radars, and weather stations (like temperature, humidity, wind)
- **Computer models** to simulate and predict future weather
- **Meteorologists**, who are experts that analyze this data and create forecasts

###  How does a weather app get its data?

Apps use something called a **Weather API** (like OpenWeatherMap) to get real-time weather updates. The API returns data like:

- Temperature
- Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
- Wind speed
- Humidity
- 5-day or hourly forecast

This app uses **JavaScript** to connect to the API and show weather details when a user types a city name.
